/**
 * @docmenuorder 1
 * @docName Workspaces
 * @intro
 * The Workspaces API offers advanced window management functionalities. Using Workspaces, users are able to arrange multiple applications 
 * within the same visual window (called *Frame*). This arrangement can be performed programmatically or by dragging and dropping applications within the Frame. 
 * Users can also save Workspace Layouts and restore them within the same Frame or even in different Frames.
 *
 * The Glue42 Workspaces enable the users to compose a custom arrangement of applications by treating each application 
 * as an individual building block that can be added, removed, moved or resized within a Workspace. 
 * The Frame can hold multiple Workspaces (as tabs) and can also be maximized, minimized or resized.
 * 
 * The Workspaces API is accessible through the `glue.workspaces` object.
