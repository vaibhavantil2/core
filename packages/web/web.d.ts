/**
 * @docmenuorder 1
 * @docname Glue42 Web
 * @intro
 * Glue42 Web allows JavasScript applications to integrate with other applications that are part of the same **Glue42 Core** project via a set of APIs. With Glue42 Web you can share data with other applications, expose functionality, manage windows and notifications.
 *
 * ## Referencing
 *
 * Glue42 Web is available both as a single JavaScript file, which you can include in your web applications using a `<script>` tag, and as a Node.js module:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/javascript" src="web.umd.js"></script>
 * ```
 *
 * Or:
 *
 * ``` javascript
 * import GlueWeb from "&commat;glue42/web";
 * ```
 *
 * When deploying your application in production, it is recommended to always reference a specific minified version:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script type="text/javascript" src="web.umd.min.js"></script>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Initialization
 *
 * Glue42 Web attaches a factory function to the global `window` object at runtime - `GlueWeb()`. It can be invoked with an optional configuration object to initialize the library and connect to the **Glue42 Core** environment. The factory function resolves with the `glue` API object:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const initializeGlue42 = async () => {
 *
 *     // Initializing the Workspaces library.
 *     const initOptions = {
 *         libraries: [GlueWorkspaces]
 *     };
 *
 *     // Use the object returned from the factory function
 *     // to access the Glue42 APIs.
 *     const glue = await GlueWeb(initOptions);
 *
 *     // Here Glue42 Web is initialized and you can access all Glue42 APIs.
 * };
 *
 * initializeGlue42().catch(console.error);
 * ```
